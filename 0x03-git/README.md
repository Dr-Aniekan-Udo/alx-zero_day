Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]
You will need a GitHub account for all your projects at ALX. If you do not already have a github.com account
Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github
To have access to your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on Github.
Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet Update your Intranet profile by adding your Github username
Step 3 - Create your first repository
Using the graphic interface on the github website, create your first repository.

-Name: alx-zero_day
-Description: I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
-Public repo
-No README, .gitignore, or license 
Step 4 - Open the sandbox
On the intranet, just under the task, click on the button  and run to start the machine.

Once the container is started, click on  to open a shell where you can start work from.
Step 5 - Clone your repository
On the webterm of the sandbox, do the following:

-Clone your repository
-Navigate to this new directory
-Create the file README.md with the content My first readme
Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin
1) Repo-session
Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your alx-zero_day repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

at the root of your repository alx-zero_day
AND in the directory 0x03-git
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
Create these empty files:
c/c_is_fun.c
js/main.js
js/index.js
Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
Add all these new files to git
Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
